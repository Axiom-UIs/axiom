## 💡 The Problem
Patients with chronic diseases often struggle to juggle multiple aspects of their health:
* Tracking complex medication schedules.
* Understanding specific nutritional needs (e.g., low sugar/sodium).
* Monitoring vitals and sharing them effectively with healthcare providers.
* Lack of motivation or emotional support.

## 🚀 The Solution
Based on our research, we designed **Medico** to serve three distinct user roles: **Patients, Doctors, and Caregivers**.

### Key Features
* **🍎 Smart Nutrition:** Personalized meal plans, recipe suggestions with allergy filters, and calorie/nutrient tracking tailored for diabetic/hypertensive needs.
* **❤️ Condition Tracking:** Real-time logging of Blood Sugar, Blood Pressure, and Heart Rate with visual progress charts.
* **💊 Medication Management:** Intelligent reminders, refill alerts, and drug interaction safety checks.
* **🆘 Emergency & Safety:** SOS alerts to family/doctors and health crisis prediction logic.
* **🤝 Connected Ecosystem:**
    * **For Doctors:** Remote monitoring dashboard and secure messaging.
    * **For Caregivers:** Shared treatment plans and alerts.
* **🎓 Educational Hub:** In-app tutorials, articles, and tips for disease management.
